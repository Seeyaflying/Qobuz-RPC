# Qobuz Discord RPC Synchronizer (GUI)

A **desktop GUI application** for Windows that automatically sets your Discord Rich Presence (RPC) status to the music you're currently playing on the **Qobuz desktop client**.

This project provides a graphical interface and continuous development on the foundation of the original command-line script.

## ‚ú® Features

* **GUI Application:** Easy-to-use graphical interface for simple control.
* **Automatic Status:** Synchronizes your Discord status with the currently playing track on Qobuz.
* **Dynamic Album Art:** Fetches album artwork from the iTunes public API for a richer presence display.

## üíª Installation & Usage (End User)

The simplest way to use this application is by downloading and running the compiled Windows executable (`.exe`). **No Python installation is required for end-users.**

### Prerequisites

1.  **Qobuz Desktop Application** must be running.
2.  **Discord Desktop Application** must be running.
3.  In Discord, go to **User Settings** $\rightarrow$ **Activity Privacy** and ensure **"Display current activity as a status message"** is enabled.

### Steps

1.  Download the latest executable directly from the [**GitHub Releases page**](https://github.com/Seeyaflying/Qobuz-RPC/releases/latest).
2.  Download the latest compiled executable file (e.g., `qobuz_rpc_gui.exe`).
3.  **Double-click** the downloaded executable to launch the GUI.
4.  Click the **"Start RPC"** button within the application window.

The application will now run in the background, continuously monitoring Qobuz and updating your Discord status.

> **Note:** Closing the main GUI window will automatically stop the RPC connection.
